# Coronary-Heart-Disease-CHD-Prediction

This project endeavours to leverage advanced data analysis and predictive modelling techniques to gain deeper insights into the factors associated with Ten-Year CHD risk and to construct a predictive model to predict the Ten-Year CHD

Given that CHD is a complex, multifactorial condition influenced by genetic, lifestyle, and medical factors, understanding their intricate interplay enhances our ability to pinpoint individuals at elevated risk.
